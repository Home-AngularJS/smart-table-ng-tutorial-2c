# To Run the Development Backend-Server

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI-Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200, but you need to use HTTPS - [https://localhost:4200](https://localhost:4200)

This application uses a self-signed certificate, so you will need to accept it using the browser. If you are using Chrome, you will need to click Advanced and then choose "Proceed to localhost".

## Angular Material Course

This repository contains the code of the [Angular Material Course](https://angular-university.io/course/angular-material-course).

This course repository is updated to Angular v8, and there is a  package-lock.json file available, for avoiding semantic versioning installation issues.

# Important

This repository has multiple branches, have a look at the beginning of each section to see the name of the branch.

At certain points along the course, you will be asked to checkout other remote branches other than master. You can view all branches that you have available remotely using the following command:

    git branch -a

  The remote branches have their starting in origin, such as for example section-1.

We can checkout the remote branch and start tracking it with a local branch that has the same name, by using the following command:

      git checkout -b section-1 origin/section-1

It's also possible to download a ZIP file for a given branch,  using the branch dropdown on this page on the top left, and then selecting the Clone or Download / Download as ZIP button.
